# 🐦 Tweet Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets using a machine learning model. It classifies tweets into **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** categories and exposes both a **web UI** and a **REST API** for real-time predictions.

---

## 🔍 Features

- Preprocessing of tweet text (cleaning, tokenization)
- ML model trained (e.g., Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes)
- Sentiment classification: Positive / Negative / Neutral
- REST API using FastAPI
- Web UI using Streamlit
- Dockerized for easy deployment

---

## 🧠 Model

The model is trained on labeled tweet data using traditional ML techniques:

- **Vectorization**: TF-IDF
- **Classifier**: Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
